      "lain that that's gonna be our first challenge. Now, interestingly Geiger, who is this uh this collaborator of Rutherford young junior collaborator of Rutherford um went on uh to develop a really neat instrument. So suppose you wanna see radiation, we do this all the time. I'm looking at you and I'm seeing radiation, seeing light, but I'm not seeing ultra high energy radiation. I'm seeing eng uh uh radiation in the op electromagnetic waves in the optical spectrum. Meanwhile, I'm also not seeing alpha particles. So what Geiger wanted was a way to detect without using your eyes radiation that's, you know, hard to see. So the way he did this is he, he took a capacitor and he filled the surrounded the capacitor with some noble gas, it doesn't interact. There's no, it's very hard to ionize. And uh if you crank up the potential across his capacitor plate high enough. What do you get a spark? Right? You, you all know this, if you crank up a capacitor eventually breaks down because the dielectric in between breaks down, you get a spontaneous sparking. So what he, what he figured was look if I take a capacitor plane and I charge it up but not quite to break down just to get a good potential. And another charge particle comes flying through like an alpha particle which carries charge plus two, that positive charge will disturb things and will add extra field effectively and lead to the Nucleation of a spark. So the presence of a spark when this potential is not strong enough to induce a spark spontaneously indicates the passage of a charged particle. Geiger worked later with um Marson Mueller Mueller, I guess. Um uh heck I don't even remember and uh and developed this into a device now known as the Geiger counter. Um And so you've probably all seen Simula or seen or heard um Geiger counters going off in movies, right? They go ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, right? They bounce off randomly. This is an extremely important lesson which is tantamo\n"

If you add with a matrix on a vector, this two by two matrix on this column vector, you get another vector. So that's the simplest example of operators acting on objects. In our case, we're gonna talk about a more so we're gonna have to begin in quantum mechanics. We're required to begin with a more sophisticated one in which the objects are gonna be object are gonna be functions. In fact, I will write complex functions of X. So let's see the list of operators and what do the operators do? The operators act on the functions. So uh what is an operator is a rule on how to take any function? And you must give a rule on how to obtain from that function, another function. So let's start with the examples is probably the easiest thing to do. So an operator acts on the functions. So an operator for any function F of X will give you another function uh function of X. And here's operator, oh We put the hat sometimes for operators. So the simplest operator operator, the operator won. We always mathematicians love to begin with trivial examples. Some, some don't illustrate anything almost and, and just can confuse you many times. But uh actually, it's good to get them out of the way. So what is the operator one? One possibility? It takes any function and gives you the number one. Do you think that's it? Who thinks it's, that's it? Nobody very good. That definitely said not a good thing to do to give you the number one. So this operator does the following. I will write it like that. The operator one takes F of X and gives you what F of X correct good. So it's a very simple operator, but it's an operator. It's like what matrix, the identity matrix. Very good. There could be a zero operator that gives you nothing and it would be the zero matrix. So let's write\n"

But here I want to emphasize that uh these, that the Eigen functions have a special property that for observables, for operators corresponding to observables. The Eigen functions form a basis. Any function can be expanded as some linear combination of these basis functions. The classic example being the fourier expansion, any function, any periodic function can be expanded as a sum of sines and cosines and any function on the real line can be expanded as a sum of exponentials E to the IKX. This is the same statement the Eigen functions of momentum are what even the IKX. And so this is the statement that an arbitrary function when the observable is the momentum. This is the statement that an arbitrary function can be expanded as a superposition or a sum of exponentials. And that's the 48. The cool. Was there a question? OK. Good. Yeah. OK. Other questions on these points. So these should not yet be trivial and obvious to you if they are, then that's great. But if they're not, we're gonna be working through examples for the next several lectures and problem sets the point now is to give you AAA grounding on which to stand fourth postulate what these expansion coefficients mean, right. And this is also an interpretation of the meaning of the wave function. What these expansion coefficients mean is that the probability that I measure the observable to be a particular eigenvalue is the norm squared of the expansion coefficient. OK. So I tell you that any function can be expanded as a superposition of plane waves waves with definite momentum with some coefficients. And those coefficients depend on which function I'm talking about. What these coefficients tell me is the probability that I will measure the momentum to be the associated value the eigenvalue. OK. Take that coefficient, take its norm squared that gives me the probability. How do we compute\n"

So when we have degenerate Eigen functions, we can take arbitrary linear combinations to them get another degenerate Eigen function cool. So this is like imagine I have a vector and I have another vector and they share the property that they're both Eigen functions of some operator. That means any linear combination of them is also right. So there's a whole vector space, there's a whole space of possible functions that all have the same eigenvalue. So now you say, well look are these two orthogonal to each other. No, these two, no. But here's the thing. If you have a vector space, if you have a space, you can always find orthogonal guys and a basis for that space. Yes. So while it's not true that the, the Eigen functions are always orthogonal, it is true, we will not prove this, but we will discuss the proof of it later by pulling the mathematician out of the closet. Um uh The proof will say that it is possible to find a set of Eigen functions which are orthogonal in precisely this fashion, even if there are degeneracy. OK. That theorem is called the spectral theorem and we'll, we'll discuss it later. Um So it is always possible to do so, but you must be alert that there may be degeneracy, there aren't always degeneracy. In fact, degeneracy are very special. Why should two numbers happen to be the same? Um Something has to be forcing them to be the same. And then that that's gonna be an important theme for us. But but it certainly is possible. Good question other questions. Yeah, all the patient. So I said in my, yeah. So using the triangular brackets, it is a is a. So there's another notation for the same thing which is FG but this carries some slightly different weight. It means something slightly, you'll see this in books and this means something very similar to this. But I'm not gonna use this notation. It's call\n"

So we know about the molecular components of cells and we understand how chemical processes occur within cells, including how energy is produced. And in my classical physics series, we learned all about energy conservation and the ways that energy can be converted from one form to another through all of the biological activity that occurs every day, all over the world.

Starch filled, pereny tissue can be found in a plant's roots and pereny. A tissue also makes up the majority of a seed so that the starches can feed the embryonic plant until it's able to photosynthesize on its own. Additionally, pereny tissue is so prevalent throughout a plant that it also takes on the role of growing to cover wounds and replace other tissues lost through physical trauma or disease. Wound closure is an important function for plants just like it is for us. Because if a plant has an open wound, then all sorts of pathogens like fungi and bacteria could invade the plant and quickly kill it.

      "The lecture discusses how the Schrödinger equation governs the time evolution of the wavefunction in quantum mechanics. Some key points about time evolution from the Schrödinger equation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Schrödinger equation is a first-order linear differential equation for the time derivative of the wavefunction Ψ(x,t):\n",
      "\n",
      "iħ ∂Ψ/∂t = ĤΨ\n",
      "\n",
      "Where Ĥ is the Hamiltonian operator representing the total energy of the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. For a state that is an energy eigenfunction Ψ = φE with eigenvalue E, the time evolution is simple:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ψ(x,t) = φE(x)e^(-iEt/ħ)\n",
      "\n",
      "The wavefunction just picks up a phase factor that oscillates at a frequency E/ħ.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Using the superposition principle, the general solution for an arbitrary initial state Ψ(x,0) can be written as a linear combination of energy eigenfunctions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ψ(x,t) = Σn cn φEn(x) e^(-iEnt/ħ)\n",
      "\n",
      "Where the coefficients cn determine the probability to measure each energy eigenvalue En.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. This shows that the Schrödinger equation provides deterministic, unitary time evolution - if the initial state is fully known, the state at any later time is determined.\n",
      "\n",
